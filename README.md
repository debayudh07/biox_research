# BioX Research Platform

A decentralized research publication and funding platform built on Solana blockchain, enabling transparent peer review, token-based funding, and democratic governance for biotechnology and life sciences research.

## 🌟 Overview

BioX Research Platform revolutionizes scientific research publication by combining blockchain technology with traditional peer review processes. Researchers can submit papers, receive community-driven funding, and engage in transparent voting mechanisms while maintaining intellectual property rights through IPFS storage.

## 🏃‍♂️ Development Commands

### Smart Contract Development
```bash
# Build contracts with IDL generation
anchor build

# Run comprehensive test suite
anchor test

# Deploy to devnet with verification
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet

# Start local validator for testing
solana-test-validator

# Generate TypeScript types
anchor build && cp target/types/* ../client/frontend/lib/
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production with optimization
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Lint code with TypeScript checks
npm run lint

# Type checking

```

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Ownership Validation**: Only authors can publish/modify their papers
- **Vote Integrity**: One vote per user per paper with weight validation
- **Fund Security**: All token transfers through SPL Token program
- **Admin Controls**: Emergency pause with role-based access
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive data validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Custom error types with descriptive messages
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Safe token transfer patterns

## 🌐 Token Economics

### BioX Platform Token
- **Standard**: SPL Token with 6 decimals
- **Purpose**: Research funding and weighted voting participation
- **Distribution**: Community-driven with transparent allocation

### Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee**: Configurable (default 2.5%, max 10%)
- **Minimum Funding**: Admin-configurable thresholds
- **Vote Weight**: `min(10, token_balance / 1_000_000)`
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient transaction batching

### Funding Mechanics
- **Goal-Based**: Papers set specific funding targets
- **Time-Limited**: Configurable funding periods
- **Auto-Resolution**: Automatic status updates when goals met
- **Transparent**: All transactions publicly auditable
